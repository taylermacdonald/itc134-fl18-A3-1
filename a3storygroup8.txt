There was a big scary bear headed towards the hikers in the woods.
The hikers ran away, unknowingly headed towards a pack of wolves.
The hikers then decided to run away again, unknowingly headed towards a troll.
Luckily for the hikers they were totally equipped to deal with a troll. The hikers, in fact, were highly awarded troll fighters.
With the trolls mercilessly butchered and since they had no prisoners the group of hikers decided to continue on their weekend hike.
 After a few hours walk and almost out of water at this point. They came upon a beautiful fountain, and decided to rest. Everyone was so tired from the days battles,It had been such a crazy day, they had decided to set camp. (The hikers surly wouldn't dare travel at night.
 No one had seen where the bear or pack of wolves ran off to in the mix.) 

After setting up camp in the last moments of daylight the hikers built a small fire to prepare a meal. Earlier that day before the bears and wolves and battles, one of the hikers had found a trap with a fresh catch. Without knowing whose trap it was, the hikers decided to take what wasn't theirs in order to eat rabbit stew for dinner.
