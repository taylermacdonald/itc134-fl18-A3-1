There was a big scary bear headed towards the hikers in the woods.
The hikers ran away, unknowingly headed towards a pack of wolves.
The hikers then decided to run away again, unknowingly headed towards a troll.
Luckily for the hikers they were totally equipped to deal with a troll. The hikers, in fact, were highly awarded troll fighters.
With the trolls mercilessly butchered and since they had no prisoners the group of hikers decided to continue on their weekend hike.
 After a few hours walk and almost out of water at this point. They came upon a beautiful fountain, and decided to rest. Everyone was so tired from the days battles,It had been such a crazy day, they had decided to set camp. (The hikers surly wouldn't dare travel at night.
 No one had seen where the bear or pack of wolves ran off to in the mix.) 
 
The campers decided to build a fire with the last few moments of day light left.
The fire was lit keeping the dark away from the campers. A wolf howled in the distance.
It would be a long and terrifying night, with little to no sleep. The campers would lay there, cold and restless on the hard ground, wondering if they would survive until morning. As the last of the embers of the fire died out, the campers could hear the Howeling getting closer.
